# visualgcodeeditor
java Visual GCODE Editor and CAD for laser engraver and simple milling (Netbeans project)

Written to use my home made CNC.
Work with GRBL Arduino (with multiple configurations)

With Some interesting things :
- 2D Edition, Bezier curve, Circle, Goups, etc.
- Wysiwyg
- basic 2D edition (rotation, scaling, translation, join, inversion)
- 2D & 3D Pockets
- Text font on existing path
- import/export in DXF, SVG, and GCODE formats
- export to OpenScad (by clipboard) 

It use some external library :
- RXTXcomm.jar
- kabeja-0.4.jar
- exp4j-0.4.8.jar

It is my personal project that I share without any guarantee, it is absolutely not finished, and will never be finished.

Take what you want from this and enjoy to adapt it to your needs, but be carful it is certainly buggy (the clipboard for example)
